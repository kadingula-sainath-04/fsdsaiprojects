# Web Scraping and XML Processing

## Project Overview
This project involves **web scraping and XML processing** to extract and clean text data from XML files. It uses Python's **ElementTree** to parse XML files and **BeautifulSoup** for HTML content extraction. The extracted data is further cleaned using regular expressions.

## Features
- Parses XML files and extracts text content.
- Removes HTML tags and unwanted elements.
- Cleans text using regular expressions.
- Utilizes **BeautifulSoup** and **ElementTree** for efficient processing.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-xml.git
   cd web-scraping-xml
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the XML file (e.g., `769952.xml`) is present in the correct directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```
3. The cleaned text will be printed to the console.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **ElementTree (ET)** for XML parsing
- **BeautifulSoup** for HTML cleaning
- **Regular Expressions (re)** for text preprocessing
- **NLTK** (can be used for additional text processing)

## Future Enhancements
- Extend functionality to process multiple XML files.
- Implement advanced NLP techniques for deeper text analysis.
- Save the cleaned data to a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
